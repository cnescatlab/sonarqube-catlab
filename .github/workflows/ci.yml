# Description
# ===========
# This workflow builds a docker image each time
# commits are pushed to GitHub or a pull request is opened.
# It also runs a container of this image to test it.
# Moreover, the hadolint linter is run on the Dockerfile and
# the yamllint linter is run on the whole project.
