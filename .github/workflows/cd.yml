# Description
# ===========
# This workflow is triggered each time all issues
# linked to a milestone which title matches
# the pattern '[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+' are closed.
# It then merges the develop branch into the master branch
# and tags the master branch with the title of the milestone.
# After, it builds a docker image and pushes the image
# to DockerHub.
# The image is tagged both with 'latest' and the milestone title.
# Finally, it creates a new Release on GitHub where it writes an
# automatically generated changelog.
# It also close the milestone (which is 100% completed).
